          Dreamwork is a series of techniques <br> developed by shamans, priests, artists and psychotherapists, <br>
          &nbsp;through which we rediscover dreams, clarifying, interacting and mutating them. <br>
          <br> It furthers our knowledge of the self, allowing us to think of it as multiple states <br>
          embodying one person. The self as landscape filled with hopeful heroes and misunderstood villains. <br>
          <br> Practicing dreamwork can help us accept the ever changing nature of life. <br> Much like dreams, life
          is chaotic and learning to work with dream can help us practice for the moments in life in which we feel most out of control.

          Dreams always contain new information which could be helpful for your life. We will work together to find this through analysing the plot and symbol to understand the different themes at play within the dream. Interpretations take shape
          as conversations in which I present hypothesis as to what the dream might mean and, through selection, we make our way closer to understanding the parallels between the dream world and waking life. Coming closer to the new information the
          dream might be trying to communicate. <br> <br>

          Creative Dreamwork veers away from interpretation, aiming to bring the dream closer to waking reality.
          Instead of interpreting what it might mean, we work with the dream as a living breathing reality, aiming
          to explore it, encounter it and learn to communicate with it. Utilising techniques like active imagination,
          ritual, and creative forms of expression as means of interaction with the archetypal figures of dream. <br> <br>

          Nightmares and recurring dreams hold a particular emotional power and therefore must be worked more carefully than
          most other dreams. Because of their durational qualities they will usually speak of old trauma and reveal to us the biggest areas of learning.
          To deal with such dreams we focus on logical progression of the dream story in trying to find practical solutions
          to deal with the problem, both in dream and through symbolic action in waking life.
         <br>
         <br>
          The focus is on mutating the image by mutating our approach to it. <br> <br>

        <p>
          The Ullman group method is a powerful tool in the facilitation of
          dreamwork as it allows any group of individuals, no matter the level of experience,
          to get together and easily explore dreams and its meaning in an effective and safe way.
         <br>
         <br>
          Though it benefits from having an experienced facilitator, it is made to be accessible for everyone to learn.
          Groups will have between 3 and 8 stable members and can slowly gain independence. <br> <br>
